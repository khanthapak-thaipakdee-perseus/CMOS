# CMOS Design and Simulation Assignments
This repository contains assignments for the ELEC472: Integrated Circuit Design course, offered by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool. The assignments focus on the design, simulation, and analysis of CMOS circuits, including inverters, NAND gates, and operational amplifiers (op-amps). All designs utilise 1.2 μm CMOS technology.
